Solution for the problem for Sikorsky hack 2021 https://sikorskyhack.4hub.com.ua/

## Main idea of the app
User scans QR code on food products in order to get their food composition, calories etc. Additional feature - specify ingredients that you do not want to eat and app will notify you when those ingredients are found in the scanned food.
Interface is done in Ukrainian.

## Demo
Just scan the QR code - it will lead you to the app. Note that because of Azure's cold start it may take some time to load in browser.
